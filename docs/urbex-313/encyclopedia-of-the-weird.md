# Creating Cryptids

Use the following template to model NPCs and monsters:

- Title (denotes the type of NPC/monster)
- NPC Name (most things have a name. Some have forgotten theirs and are now solely defined by their title)
- X HP, X Armor, X STR, X DEX, X CTRL,
- Attack (dX, special items, qualities)
- Description (appearance or demeanor)
- Drive, behavior, tactic, or peculiarity
- Special effect or critical damage consequence.

## General Principles

- Ability Scores are 10 unless noted.
- Ability Scores: 3 is deficient, 6 is weak, 10 is average, 14 is noteworthy, and 18 is legendary.
- HP: 3 HP is average , 6 HP sturdy, 1 0+ HP is serious threat
- HP is Hit Protection, not a measure of Hit Points. It’s a measure of skill, luck, drive, resilience.
- Flavor and style = memorable
- Use d6 as the baseline for damage.
- Including ways to deal stress makes the game more Weird (increases chance of Stress Fallout)
- Critical Damage triggers increase threat or strangeness

### Creature Cheat Sheet:

- Able to avoid being hit? Give it **HP**.
- Soak up damage? Give it **Armor**.
- Physically powerful? Give it a high **STR** or larger damage dice.
- Quick? Give it high **DEX**.
- Weird? Give it high **CTRL** or ability to deal Stress Damage.

# Ada Witch

Originally from the town of Ada, this ghostly lover's triangle has been making the rounds for decades. Sometime during the 19th century, a woman named Sarah McMillian had been unfaithful to her husband and would disappear at night to meet with her lover. Her husband suspected something and one night feigned sleep. His wife got up and left the house, so he followed and found her in the arms of another man. He killed his wife first, then attacked her lover. The two men fought, and both died from their wounds. Unknown to both her husband and her lover, Sarah was a witch, and all three returned from the dead as ghosts. Now Sarah must get her husband and lover must work together before she moves on to the realm of the dead.
